# ecomodelmarkdowns

Stand alone markdowns with embedded shiny apps for various eco and epi models

Current markdowns (July 14, 2023) are:
_____

catalytic.rmd -- Simmple exploration of the catalytic model using rabitt data

ddetortrix.rmd - Nelson et al's (2013) model of temperature dependent destabilization of insect dynamics

jacobian.rmd - General purpose Jacobian calculator(s) (not shiny App)

lotkavolterracompetition.rmd - Lotka-Volterra competion model

lotkavolterrapredation.rmd - Lotka-Volterra predation model

lpatribolium.rmd - Larvae-Pupae-Adult Tribolium model

nextgenR0.rmd - general purpose code for calculating R0 for compartemental models using next-generation formalism (not shiny App)

outbreakresponsevaccination.rmd - ORV model based on the SIR with vaccination campaigns

parasitoidhost.rmd - Nicholson-Bailey Host-Parasitoid model AND May's Negative-Binomial parasitoid-host model

ricker.rmd - The Ricker ('discrete logisitic') model

rosenzweigmacarthur.rmd - Rosenzweig-MacArthur Predator-Prey model

rossmacdonald.rmd - A simple Ross-Macdonald type malaria model

seasonalseir.rmd - the seasonally forced SEIR model

sir.rmd - the unforced SIR model

spatialparasitoidhost.rmd - Coupled map lattice model of spatially extended host-parasitoid dynamics

spatiallbm.rmd - the spatially extended model of host-parasitoid dynamics that leads to waves of spread of the larch budmoth

In addition I recommend taking a peak at: 

SIR: https://martinkrz.github.io/posepi1/

SEIRS: https://martinkrz.github.io/posepi2/

EVPI: https://martinkrz.github.io/posepi3/
____

If opened in Rstudio "> Run Document" will run the App.
